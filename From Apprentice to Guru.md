  * [Discover list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)
    * [List, Dict And Set Comprehensions](https://www.smallsurething.com/list-dict-and-set-comprehensions-by-example/)
  * [Discover generators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/102535/what-can-you-use-python-generator-functions-for)
  * Incorporate map, reduce, filter, iter, range, xrange often into your code
    * [Map, Reduce, and Filter](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html) 
  * [Discover Decorators](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html)
  * Write recursive functions, a lot
  * Discover itertools and functools
    * itertools
     * [count, cycle and chain](https://www.novixys.com/blog/python-itertools-count-cycle-chain/)
     * [compress, dropwhile, takewhile, groupby](https://www.novixys.com/blog/python-itertools-compress-dropwhile-takewhile-groupby/) 
     * [ifilter, islice, imap, izip](https://www.novixys.com/blog/python-itertools-ifilter-islice-imap-izip/) 
  * Read Real World Haskell (read free online)
  * Rewrite all your old Python code with tons of higher order functions, recursion, and whatnot.
  * Annoy your cubicle mates every time they present you with a Python class. Claim it could be "better" implemented as a dictionary plus some functions. Embrace functional programming.
  * Rediscover the Strategy pattern and then all those things from imperative code you tried so hard to forget after Haskell.
  * Find a balance.
